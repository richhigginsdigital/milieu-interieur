      &ldquo;Establishing boundaries and understanding variations in effective
      immune response.&rdquo;
    </h1>
    <p>
      While the immune system is highly complex and responses are known to vary
      across individuals and populations, medical practices and public health
      policies remain based on a single model of patient care and drug
      development. The Milieu Intérieur project was initiated specifically to
      address this discrepancy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary objective of our work is to establish the boundaries of a
      "healthy" immune response and define the determinants of immune response
      variation, integrating the relationship among genetics, epigenetics and
      the environment. The specific aims of the Milieu Intérieur project are to:
    </p>

    <p>
      (i) define the naturally-occurring variability of human immune response,
    </p>

    <p>
      (ii) assess how this variation is genetically, epigenetically or
      environmentally controlled,
    </p>

    <p>
      (iii) understand how this genetic/phenotypic variation may account for
      differences in susceptibility to infection, therapeutic treatment or
      vaccine response, and
    </p>

    <p>
      (iv) ascertain the variation and role of the microbiota in regulating
      immune programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Milieu Intérieur project is poised to have a strong impact on public
      health, as the data generated will greatly improve our understanding of
      individual variability in immune response. In doing so, we will provide
      new strategies for adapting treatments with a view to developing a
      personalized approach to patient care.
